scheme_calculator
=================
In this project, I developed an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language, thinking about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language.  Many quirks of languages are the byproduct of implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers.

I implemented some programs in Scheme, including the count_change function and learned that scheme is a simple but powerful functional language.  

This project includes several files, but all of your changes made to the first three: scheme.py, scheme_reader.py, and tests.scm.
